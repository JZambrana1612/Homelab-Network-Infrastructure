# üõ°Ô∏è Home Network Security & Optimization

This document captures the security hardening and wireless optimization applied to the TP‚ÄëLink Archer BE6500 (Wi‚ÄëFi 7) after upgrading to Frontier Fiber 1 Gbps. It complements the VPN and Proxmox setup guides in this repository.

## ‚úÖ Security Hardening

### Wi‚ÄëFi Encryption
- **SSID_MLO**: WPA3‚ÄëPersonal (primary network for modern devices).  
- **SSID_NAME**: WPA2/WPA3 mixed mode (legacy compatibility).  
- **Why**: Ensures modern clients prefer WPA3 while older devices can still connect.

### WPS Disabled
- **Why**: Removes a well‚Äëknown brute‚Äëforce attack vector (PIN method).

### Group Key Update Period ‚Üí 3600s
- **Why**: Forces hourly re‚Äëkeying to limit risks from long‚Äëterm key reuse/replay.

### DNS over TLS (DoT) with AdGuard DNS
- **What**: Encrypted DNS lookups and filtering for ads, trackers, malicious domains.  
- **Why**: Improves privacy and reduces junk traffic at the network edge.

## ‚ö° Wireless Optimization

### Channel Configuration
- **2.4 GHz**: Locked to **Channel 6**, **20 MHz** width for stability in congested bands.  
- **5 GHz**: **Auto channel** with **DFS enabled** for higher throughput and less congestion.

### Advanced Wireless Features
- **Airtime Fairness**, **MU‚ÄëMIMO**, and **OFDMA**: **Enabled** for efficient multi‚Äëclient performance (Wi‚ÄëFi 6/7).  
- **DTIM Interval**: Left at **1** for better latency on real‚Äëtime apps.  
- **Beacon/RTS/Other**: Kept at stable defaults per vendor guidance.

### SSID Strategy
- **SSID_MLO** ‚Üí WPA3‚Äëonly, main SSID for modern devices.  
- **SSID_NAME** ‚Üí WPA2/WPA3 mixed, fallback for older clients.  
- **Guest/IoT** ‚Üí Deferred for now.

## üîí Network Controls

### Client Identification
- **What**: Renamed known clients (PC, work PC, phone); monitored device list for unknowns (discarded transient ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù blip).

### Future: IP & MAC Binding (ARP Binding)
- **Goal**: Prevent LAN ARP spoofing by binding static IPs to MACs for critical hosts.  
- **Planned bindings**:  
  - Proxmox host  
  - NAS (when added)  
  - Main PC  
  - *(Optional)* PS5 & phone

### Access Control
- **Current**: Disabled (monitor‚Äëonly posture).  
- **Future**: Consider **Allow‚ÄëList** mode for small, tightly‚Äëcontrolled LANs.

## üåê NAT & Gaming Considerations

### UPnP
- **Current**: **ON** for easier gameplay/connectivity on consoles/PC.  
- **Future**: Plan to disable and replace with manual port forwards for tighter control.

### (Future) Manual Port Forwarding References
- **PS5**: TCP **80, 443, 3478‚Äì3480** / UDP **3478‚Äì3479**  
- **Steam**: UDP **27000‚Äì27100**, UDP/TCP **27031‚Äì27036**  
- **Epic Games**: TCP/UDP **80**, TCP **443**, UDP **3478‚Äì3479**  
- *(Other launchers seldom need custom rules.)*

## üõ°Ô∏è Future Considerations

### LAN Redesign
- Migrate LAN from **192.168.x.x/24 ‚Üí 192.168.y.x/24** for cleaner addressing and easier subnet management.  
- Reserve static IPs for critical infrastructure (Proxmox host, NAS, main PC), while keeping DHCP pools for general devices.  
- This redesign will also simplify VPN routing and static bindings across VLANs.

### Segmentation & VLANs
- Current limitation: the TP-Link BE6500 provides a stable VPN endpoint but VLAN tagging is limited to wired ports.  
- Goal: Extend segmentation to **Homelab, Personal, and IoT networks**, ensuring VPN users on **wireless SSIDs** receive the same isolation as Ethernet devices.  
- To achieve this, we‚Äôre evaluating a **TP-Link Omada Access Point**, which introduces SSID-based VLAN tagging for full wireless coverage.

### Dedicated Firewall / Security Layer
- While the router-based OpenVPN server is effective, it lacks advanced features such as **inter-VLAN routing, IDS/IPS, and detailed per-device policies**.  
- Two paths under consideration:  
  - **Virtualized Firewall**: pfSense or OPNsense deployed on Proxmox for fine-grained control, traffic inspection, and custom VPN policies.  
  - **Dedicated Security Appliance**: Firewalla‚Äôs *Cybersecurity Gold* line, offering an accessible, user-friendly management interface while maintaining enterprise-grade protection.  
- Either approach would strengthen our VPN setup, close current segmentation gaps, and prepare the network for future scalability.

## ‚ö° TL;DR
- Disabled risky defaults (WPS, remote management, EasyMesh).  
- Hardened wireless (WPA3 first, hourly key rotation, channel optimization).  
- Secured DNS via **AdGuard over DoT**.  
- Staged next steps: **IP/MAC binding**, VLANs, and a **dedicated firewall**.

# 🏡 Home-Lab Network Infrastructure Project

This repository documents the setup and ongoing development of my personal homelab environment. While it serves as part of my professional portfolio, it is equally designed as a practical guide for others interested in creating their own homelab networks. My goal is to share both successes and challenges in a way that makes complex IT, networking, and cybersecurity concepts more approachable, user-friendly, and replicable for anyone starting their own journey.

## 💡 A Note on Learning & Frustration

Building a homelab can be both exciting and challenging. While this repository is designed to make concepts user-friendly, there will be times when things feel overly complicated or don’t work as expected on the first try. From personal experience, I’ve had many setbacks and moments of frustration — but those same moments make the successes far more rewarding.

If you ever get stuck, I recommend taking a day or two away from the project and returning with fresh eyes. More than likely, you won’t get everything working perfectly on the first attempt — and that’s completely normal.  

Some topics in this repository may lean more advanced, while others highlight user-friendly alternatives and products. The idea is to show multiple paths forward so you can choose the approach that fits your comfort level.

This project also assumes familiarity with common networking acronyms and jargon. If anything feels unfamiliar, a quick search will usually clarify things — and often lead you to new learning opportunities.

## 📊 Logical Network Topology

The diagram above represents the logical design of the homelab, including VLAN groupings, firewall placement, and switch segmentation.  

---

## 📌 Current Environment

### Router & Wireless Segmentation
- TP-Link Archer BE6500 (Wi-Fi 7) deployed as core router.  
- **SSID_MLO** → WPA3-only, for modern/high-bandwidth devices (gaming PC, PS5, Proxmox).  
- **SSID_NAME** → WPA2/WPA3 mixed mode, fallback for legacy/IoT devices.  
- Security measures applied:  
  - WPA3 prioritized, legacy fallback limited  
  - WPS disabled  
  - DNS over TLS with AdGuard DNS  
  - EasyMesh disabled  
  - Remote management disabled  
  - SPI Firewall enabled, WAN ping disabled

### Switch
- **Upgraded to TP-Link TL-SG1024DE Easy Smart Switch** (previously TL-SG705 unmanaged).  
- Provides VLAN management, loop prevention, and QoS features.  
- Current VLAN assignments documented below.  

### Proxmox Virtualization
- Running on Dell OptiPlex 7020 Micro (repurposed from BitLocker lock).  
- Installed **Proxmox VE 9.0** via bootable USB (Rufus).  
- Configured:  
  - Static IP addressing  
  - Correct gateway and DNS (AdGuard)  
  - Wiped legacy partitions and allocated storage for virtualization.  
- Added basic Linux tools (`tree`) for navigation.  
- Partitioned 14GB to `lxc-storage (pve)` (not sufficient for hosting — NAS planned).  
- After struggling to determine the purpose of the Proxmox device, began attempting virtualization installs.  
  - Initial Ubuntu Server installation failed.  
  - Attempted NAS-backed Ubuntu install via UGREEN NAS — also failed.  
  - Switched to Alpine Linux as a lightweight alternative — failed again.  
  - Set project aside temporarily.  
  - Returned and successfully installed Ubuntu Server with improved resource allocation (4GB RAM, host has 8GB total).
- First successful VM deployment used to host a Minecraft server:
  - Installed Java 1.21
  - Downloaded and configured Minecraft Java Edition 1.21.8
  - Created dedicated `minecraft` user and a new file directory
  - Corrected an IP conflict caused by assigning a reserved address
  - Updated `server.properties` with the correct static IP
  - Successfully tested LAN access
  - Verified WAN functionality using dynamic DNS (external user was able to join)

### VPN
- OpenVPN server configured directly on the Archer BE6500.  
- Certificate generated and exported with DDNS hostname.  
- Client profile imported into OpenVPN Connect.  
- Remote testing verified: LAN access works, IP routing confirmed.  
- Documented sanitized screenshots of connection process.

## 🖧 VLAN Segmentation

| VLAN | Purpose               | Devices / Ports                                      |
|------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 10   | Management             | Router uplink (F0/1), Gaming PC (optional)           |
| 20   | Servers / Infra        | Proxmox (F0/2), VM Practice (F0/4), NAS (F0/6)       |
| 30   | Media / Entertainment  | Printer (F0/19), PS5 (F0/21), Smart TV (F0/23), Future Media (F0/17) |
| 40   | Wireless / IoT (2.4GHz)| Phones, IoT devices (SSID_NAME)                      |
| 50   | High-Perf Wi-Fi        | Gaming PC (SSID_MLO)                                 |

> **Note 1:** As of 2025-09-10, VLAN functionality has been temporarily disabled due to router limitations with inter-VLAN routing. See "Homelab Journal" section for more details.  
> **Note 2:** The Gaming PC is primarily assigned to VLAN 50 for high-performance Wi-Fi, but can also be temporarily assigned to VLAN 10 for homelab management (e.g., Proxmox or NAS administration).

## 🚧 Future Plans

- Enable **IP/MAC Binding** for critical hosts (Proxmox, NAS, main PC).  
- Configure **manual port forwarding** (replace UPnP) for gaming services (PS5, Steam, Epic).  
- Implement **VLAN segmentation** (Homelab / IoT / Personal).  
- Migrate LAN subnet from **192.168.0.0/24 → 192.168.10.0/24** for cleaner addressing.  
- Evaluate **pfSense/OPNsense** (dedicated or VM) for IDS/IPS and advanced firewall rules.  
- Deploy **virtual honeypots** (via Proxmox or Azure) for traffic logging and analysis.  
- Maintain Ubuntu VM running a Minecraft server for internal and external access.  

These future steps will continue expanding the homelab’s capabilities, with a particular focus on security, segmentation, and practical documentation. The next logical phase is exploring a dedicated firewall solution that can bridge the gap between consumer-grade routers and enterprise-style security.

## 🌱 Closing Note & Next Steps

This repository now represents the **completed barebones structure** of the homelab network. It’s meant to serve as a starting point — simple enough for newcomers to replicate, while still showing how consumer-grade equipment can be pushed toward enterprise-style concepts.

Rather than overloading this repository with every advanced configuration, future projects will be broken out into their own dedicated repositories. This way, each topic remains focused, approachable, and easier to follow step by step.  

Upcoming repositories will include:  
- **Starting Your First Ubuntu Server VM on Proxmox**  
- **Installing and Configuring Pi-hole for DNS Filtering**  
- **Creating and Exposing a Honeypot on Azure for Cybersecurity Testing**  

By keeping the homelab foundation lightweight here, and branching into more advanced topics separately, the overall goal remains the same:  
**to share lessons learned, highlight both enterprise-grade and user-friendly approaches, and inspire others to keep experimenting — even when it gets frustrating.**
